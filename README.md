# Holiday Manager

This is a plataform for users to create and manage their holiday plans. Users can also invite their friend into their Holiday Plan in case of group holidays.

Created using Next.js, Tailwind, Drizzle ORM and Neon.

## Possible expansions

- Implement email delivery using Resend.
- Integrate Google Maps to show the location of a Plan/Activity based on its address.
- Implement a WYSIWYG text editor to replace the Plan/Activity description textarea to allow for a more complete and "personalized" description.
