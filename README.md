# Holiday Manager

Project in-development

This is a platform for users to create and manage their holiday plans. Users can also invite their friends into their Holiday Plan in case of group holidays.

Developed with Next.js, Tailwind, Drizzle ORM, and Neon.

## Possible expansions

- Implement email delivery using Resend.
- Integrate Google Maps to show the location of a Plan/Activity based on its address.
- Implement a WYSIWYG text editor to replace the Plan/Activity description textarea to allow for a more complete and "custom" description text.
